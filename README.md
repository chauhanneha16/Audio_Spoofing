Spoof detection involves several key steps:

Feature Extraction: Extracting specific features related to vocal tract arrangement from audio signals. In this process, features such as the positions and movements of articulators are identified. Common techniques include using Mel spectrogram features along with centroid analysis.

Model Training: Training machine learning models, including classifiers or neural networks, on a dataset containing both real and deepfake audio samples. These models learn to distinguish between features associated with genuine speech production and those indicative of deepfake generation. Various deep learning approaches like CNN, Transformer, and combinations such as CNN+Transformer are employed in this work.

Detection: During the detection phase, the trained models analyze the features extracted from new audio samples to determine whether they are more likely to be genuine or deepfake. If the features resemble those associated with deepfake generation, the sample is flagged as a potential deepfake. The model is evaluated on unseen audio data to ensure its capability to identify whether the input audio is genuine or spoofed.

 Transformer-based neural network architecture for voice spoofing detection has been impleted

Input Layer: Defines the input shape for the Transformer model based on the number of mel-frequency spectrogram coefficients (N_MELS) and the number of frames (X_train.shape[2]).

Positional Encoding: Incorporates positional encoding to provide positional information to the model.

Transformer Layers: Utilizes multiple Transformer layers consisting of multi-head self-attention mechanisms followed by feed-forward neural networks. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and extract meaningful features from the input spectrograms.

Global Average Pooling: Aggregates the output of the Transformer layers across all time steps to generate a fixed-length representation of the input sequence.

Output Layer: Produces the final classification output using a softmax activation function, indicating the probability distribution over the different classes (real or fake).

Model Compilation: Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, with accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Model Summary: Prints a summary of the model architecture, detailing the layers, shapes, and parameters.

This architecture leverages the power of Transformer-based models to effectively detect voice spoofing by learning discriminative features from the input spectrograms.
